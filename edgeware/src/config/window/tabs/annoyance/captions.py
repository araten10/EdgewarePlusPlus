CAPTION_TEXT = "These settings below will only work for compatible packs, but use captions to add new features. The first checks the caption's mood with the filename of the popup image, and links the caption if they match. The second allows for captions of a certain mood to make the popup require multiple clicks to close. More detailed info on both these settings can be found in the hover tooltip."
SUBLIMINAL_TEXT = 'Subliminal message popups briefly flash a caption on screen in big, bold text before disappearing.\n\nThis is largely meant to be for short, minimal captions such as "OBEY", "DROOL", and other vaguely fetishy things. "Use Subliminal specific mood" allows for this without interfering with other captions, as it uses the special mood "subliminals" which don\'t appear in the regular caption pool. However, these subliminals are set by the pack creator, so if none are set the default will be used instead.'
