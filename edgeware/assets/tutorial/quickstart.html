      <p>Want to get Edgeware++ up and running as fast as possible? The default settings are okay, but are very basic. In this section we'll list all the settings you should change before trying Edgeware++ for the first time.</p>
      <p>I still <b>highly</b> recommend the other tutorials in this window for new users. If you want to learn more about the program and how everything works, check out the other tutorial tabs first, then come back here for a brief refresher. However, if you want to skip that and get started immediately, then this is for you!</p>

    <center><h3>IMPORTANT</h3></center>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li><b>General → Start</b>. Set <b>Global Panic Key</b> to something you won't accidentally activate, but can also be easily pressed. If you are on windows, you may need to tab out to your desktop to set the hotkey, this is a bug and should hopefully be fixed!</li>
        <li><b>General → Start</b>. Ensure that <b>Warn if "Dangerous" Settings Active</b> is turned <b>on</b>, unless you know what you're doing. It should be on by default, but doesn't hurt to double check.</li>
        <li><b>Annoyance/Runtime → Wallpaper</b>. Set your panic wallpaper using <b>Auto Import</b> (preferable) or <b>Set Panic Wallpaper</b>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With these settings on, you now have an easy way to quit Edgeware++ while also reverting your wallpaper to what is currently set on your computer.</p>
    </div>
    <center><h3>Annoyance/Runtime → Popup Types</h3></center>
    <div>
      <p><b>General Popup Frequency</b> is the most important setting in this tab. To start, I recommend setting it to <b>8000-10000</b>, although you may want to change it later.</p>
      <p>For the types themselves, I recommend prioritizing images and video and give every other popup type a very small percentage:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep <b>Images</b> at 100%.</li>
        <li>Turn <b>Videos</b> up to ~10%.</li>
        <li>Have <b>Subliminals</b> at around 5%.</li>
        <li>Put <b>Audio</b> at 3%.</li>
        <li><b>Prompts</b> and <b>Website</b> are more annoying if they pop up frequently, so try having them at 1-2%. (You can turn website up more if you want)</li>
        <li><b>Notifications</b> depends entirely on your OS and how it decides to handle them, you can try them at 3-5%.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
