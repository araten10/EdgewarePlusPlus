      <p>Alright, so you've imported your first Edgeware++ pack and you know how to run the program, now what? Well, you could just run it as-is, but it's likely you'll find it inadequate. Sure, the popups work fine and the porn is properly loading, but maybe you want to made them appear slower or have videos show up more often... no worries! There are tons of settings to mess around with in Edgeware++.</p>
      <p>Well, almost <i>too</i> many. I started writing this tutorial because the program was becoming increasingly dense, impenetrable to most new users. I like having a lot of customization options for people who want to truly make Edgeware++ their own, but I also want to focus on helping people not be immediately turned away by a wall of text and checkboxes. So don't worry, we'll go through it together!</p>
      <p>This section is dedicated specifically to simple settings and tabs that most people will likely want to change. What is considered "simple" is subjective of course, but most of the things covered here can be explained very quickly and will drastically change your horny-popup-program experience!</p>
