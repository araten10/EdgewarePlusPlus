      <p>Alright, so you've imported your first Edgeware++ pack and you know how to run the program, now what? Well, you could just run it as-is, but it's likely you'll find it inadequate. Sure, the popups work fine and the porn is properly loading, but maybe you want to made them appear slower or have videos show up more often... no worries! There are tons of settings to mess around with in Edgeware++.</p>
      <p>Well, almost <i>too</i> many. I started writing this tutorial because the program was becoming increasingly dense, impenetrable to most new users. I like having a lot of customization options for people who want to truly make Edgeware++ their own, but I also want to focus on helping people not be immediately turned away by a wall of text and checkboxes. So don't worry, we'll go through it together!</p>
      <p>This section is dedicated specifically to simple settings and tabs that most people will likely want to change. What is considered "simple" is subjective of course, but most of the things covered here can be explained very quickly and will drastically change your horny-popup-program experience!</p>
    </div>
    <center><h2>Tabs</h2></center>
    <img src="images/bs1.png" alt="List of edgeware++ tabs" class="center">
    <div>
      <p>At the top of the config window are several tabs to help you navigate through Edgeware++ settings. Some of them contain "sub-tabs" to help further categorize settings. The main tabs are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>General</b>- Meta settings centered around managing Edgeware++ as a program, and viewing current pack information.</li>
        <li><b>Annoyance/Runtime</b>- Settings that are visible while Edgeware++ is running, such as popup frequency, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Modes</b>- Large-scale settings that drastically change how Edgeware++ works.</li>
        <li><b>Corruption</b>- An even larger scale change-over-time mode that is detailed enough to warrant its own tab!</li>
        <li><b>Troubleshooting</b>- Settings based around compatibility or legacy features.</li>
        <li><b>Tutorial</b>- You're here right now!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In this section of the tutorial we'll mostly be covering settings in the <b>Annoyance/Runtime</b> tab, while briefly going over summaries of <b>Modes</b> and <b>Corruption</b>. The annoyance tab contains most of the useful settings for Edgeware++, so it deserves special attention!</p>
      <p>But before we do that, let's check out some useful things in the <b>General</b> tab!</p>
    </div>
    <center><h2>The "General" Tab</h2></center>
    <img src="images/bs2.png" alt="Screenshot of the general tab" class="center">
    <div>
      <p>Welcome to the <b>General</b> tab. The settings in here are overall less exciting than stuff in the annoyance tab, but they're a very good starting point. Immediately you'll notice that there's a bunch of useful "section hints" that can give you advice on what certain settings do. This can also be disabled with the setting "Disable Config Help Messages" inside <b>General Settings</b> on this tab... but I don't recommend it until you have more experience with the program!</p>
      <p>Speaking of <b>General Settings</b>, that's where most of the really useful things in this tab are! Have you noticed that you can hover over certain settings to get more information on them? It's always denoted by your cursor turning into a question mark! Usually this is where information on smaller settings is kept, so if you're not entirely sure on what something does, try hovering over it! I won't go over every setting in this section, but here's some very important ones that warrant talking about:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>"Warn if Dangerous Settings Active"</b> is a very important safety feature for new users, so much so that it's on by default! There are a few settings inside Edgeware++ that can negatively affect the user if turned on while unaware, so this setting alerts you before you save them. What are these so called "Dangerous Settings"? You can see a full list of what is considered dangerous by hovering over this warning setting, but most of them are confined to the sub-tab called <b>Dangerous</b>! (who could have guessed, not me!)</li>
        <li><b>"Show Loading Flair"</b> spawns a short "introductory" image whenever Edgeware++ is launched. This can be annoying if you want to quickly launch Edgeware++ a bunch of times in a short period (testing out a pack you've made, for example), but the reason I single it out here is because packs can sometimes have custom ones. It's also a great way to know that Edgeware++ is starting up, so try turning or leaving it on if you're trying out a new pack! It might have a custom piece of porn for you~</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There's one last extremely important thing in the General tab before we get to the fun stuff: Setting your <b>panic hotkey</b>. You might remember panic from the previous tutorial- it closes all popups and force-ends Edgeware++! Setting up a hotkey to do this for you at any time is extremely useful, so make sure you put it on something you won't forget! If the hotkey here doesn't work, you can check out a legacy setting in the <b>Troubleshooting</b> tab!</p>
      <center><h2>Annoyance</h2></center>
      <img src="images/bs3.png" alt="Screenshot of the popup types tab" class="center">
      <p>Here's the tab where most of the important features live! It's the <b>"Annoyance"</b> tab, which refers to the fact that most of the "annoying" popup settings can be found here! Admittedly it's a bit of a confusing name considering your pack should probably be making you horny instead of annoying you... but that's what it was called during original Edgeware, and we carried it on into Edgeware++!</p>
      <p>There's two main sections we're going to look at: Popup Types and Popup Tweaks. The first one, popup types, is shown in the picture above. It's essentially the sub-tab where you decide what types of files appear when you run Edgeware++. Most of them have pretty in-depth help text, so i'll only briefly go over them here:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Image Popups</b>: Self explanatory! This is the main type of popup in Edgeware++.</li>
        <li><b>Audio Popups</b>: Audio that plays without any visual component.</li>
        <li><b>Video Popups</b>: Video, usually .mp4 files, that can play in full motion. Otherwise identical to image popups!</li>
        <li><b>Website Popups</b>: Opens your web browser to display a webpage!</li>
        <li><b>Prompt Popups</b>: Makes you type in a prompt before you can close it!</li>
        <li><b>Subliminal Popups</b>: Full-screen sized text that is meant to briefly flash before disappearing!</li>
        <li><b>Notification Popups</b>: Popups that display in your "notifications" section of your OS. Can include images as well!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Phew! That was a lot! One last thing: you might have noticed a section at the very top called "General Popup Frequency". This is a <b>very</b> important section! Perhaps the most important. "Popup Timer Delay" is the core of how Edgeware++ works- when the elapsed time set here is met, a new popup is spawned. Edgeware++ uses milliseconds (1/1000th of a second) to time this, so if you want a popup to spawn every 3 seconds, you can set popup timer delay to 3000. For your very first runthrough of the program, I highly recommend setting it to 8000-10000... this might seem glacially slow when trying to run the program as intended (unless you like more unintrusive experiences), but is a nice safe way to see how it works without getting overwhelmed!</p>
