      <p>Alright, so you've imported your first Edgeware++ pack and you know how to run the program, now what? Well, you could just run it as-is, but it's likely you'll find it inadequate. Sure, the popups work fine and the porn is properly loading, but maybe you want to made them appear slower or have videos show up more often... no worries! There are tons of settings to mess around with in Edgeware++.</p>
      <p>Well, almost <i>too</i> many. I started writing this tutorial because the program was becoming increasingly dense, impenetrable to most new users. I like having a lot of customization options for people who want to truly make Edgeware++ their own, but I also want to focus on helping people not be immediately turned away by a wall of text and checkboxes. So don't worry, we'll go through it together!</p>
      <p>This section is dedicated specifically to simple settings and tabs that most people will likely want to change. What is considered "simple" is subjective of course, but most of the things covered here can be explained very quickly and will drastically change your horny-popup-program experience!</p>
    </div>
    <center><h2>Tabs</h2></center>
    <img src="images/bs1.png" alt="List of edgeware++ tabs" class="center">
    <div>
      <p>At the top of the config window are several tabs to help you navigate through Edgeware++ settings. Some of them contain "sub-tabs" to help further categorize settings. The main tabs are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>General</b>- Meta settings centered around managing Edgeware++ as a program, and viewing current pack information.</li>
        <li><b>Annoyance/Runtime</b>- Settings that are visible while Edgeware++ is running, such as popup frequency, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Modes</b>- Large-scale settings that drastically change how Edgeware++ works.</li>
        <li><b>Corruption</b>- An even larger scale change-over-time mode that is detailed enough to warrant its own tab!</li>
        <li><b>Troubleshooting</b>- Settings based around compatibility or legacy features.</li>
        <li><b>Tutorial</b>- You're here right now!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In this section of the tutorial we'll mostly be covering settings in the <b>Annoyance/Runtime</b> tab, while briefly going over summaries of <b>Modes</b> and <b>Corruption</b>. The annoyance tab contains most of the useful settings for Edgeware++, so it deserves special attention!</p>
      <p>But before we do that, let's check out some useful things in the <b>General</b> tab!</p>
    </div>
    <center><h2>The "General" Tab</h2></center>
    <img src="images/bs2.png" alt="Screenshot of the general tab" class="center">
    <div>
      <p>Welcome to the <b>General</b> tab. The settings in here are overall less exciting than stuff in the annoyance tab, but they're a very good starting point. Immediately you'll notice that there's a bunch of useful "section hints" that can give you advice on what certain settings do. This can also be disabled with the setting "Disable Config Help Messages" inside <b>General Settings</b> on this tab... but I don't recommend it until you have more experience with the program!</p>
      <p>Speaking of <b>General Settings</b>, that's where most of the really useful things in this tab are! Have you noticed that you can hover over certain settings to get more information on them? It's always denoted by your cursor turning into a question mark! Usually this is where information on smaller settings is kept, so if you're not entirely sure on what something does, try hovering over it! I won't go over every setting in this section, but here's some very important ones that warrant talking about:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>"Warn if Dangerous Settings Active"</b> is a very important safety feature for new users, so much so that it's on by default! There are a few settings inside Edgeware++ that can negatively affect the user if turned on while unaware, so this setting alerts you before you save them. What are these so called "Dangerous Settings"? You can see a full list of what is considered dangerous by hovering over this warning setting, but most of them are confined to the sub-tab called <b>Dangerous</b>! (who could have guessed, not me!)</li>
        <li><b>"Show Loading Flair"</b> spawns a short "introductory" image whenever Edgeware++ is launched. This can be annoying if you want to quickly launch Edgeware++ a bunch of times in a short period (testing out a pack you've made, for example), but the reason I single it out here is because packs can sometimes have custom ones. It's also a great way to know that Edgeware++ is starting up, so try turning or leaving it on if you're trying out a new pack! It might have a custom piece of porn for you~</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There's one last extremely important thing in the General tab before we get to the fun stuff: Setting your <b>panic hotkey</b>. You might remember panic from the previous tutorial- it closes all popups and force-ends Edgeware++! Setting up a hotkey to do this for you at any time is extremely useful, so make sure you put it on something you won't forget! If the hotkey here doesn't work, you can check out a legacy setting in the <b>Troubleshooting</b> tab!</p>
